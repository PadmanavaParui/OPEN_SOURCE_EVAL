# 📈 Global Economic Trends Dashboard

A data visualization dashboard built to track and compare macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, and unemployment) across various countries.

## 📖 About The Project

This project was built to solve the challenge of visualizing complex and often siloed macroeconomic data. It provides a clean, interactive interface for users to select countries and specific indicators, rendering comparative charts to show economic trends over time.

The primary data source is the **World Bank Open Data API**2, providing reliable, standardized data from across the globe.
